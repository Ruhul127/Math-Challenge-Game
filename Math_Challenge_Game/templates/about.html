        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Math Challenge Game presents you with:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A target number to reach (between 100 and 1000)</li>
            <li>Six random numbers (between 5 and 30)</li>
            <li>Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your challenge is to combine the given numbers using these operations to reach the target number. You can use each number only once, but you don't have to use all of them.</p>
        <p>We provide hints and solutions to help you learn different approaches to solving each challenge.</p>
